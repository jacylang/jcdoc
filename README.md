# _jcdoc_

_jcdoc_ is a framework for generating _Jacy_ documentation.
It also includes universal generator for static web pages and should be used as non-code documentation generator in _Jacy_ project.

__For now, as _Jacy_ is very WIP, _jcdoc_ does not implement functionality for code documentation generation, it only acts as web pages generator__
